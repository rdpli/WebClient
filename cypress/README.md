## How to get intelligent code suggestions

The tsconfig.json file inside the main Cypress folder is enough to get your IDE of choice to get intelligent code suggestions (Intellisense if you are using Visual Studio Code).

For more info regarding the subject, check the original Cypress documentation:
https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/intelligent-code-completion.html

## Running Cypress
After installing the Angular project, run & install Cypress via the following command:
'npm run e2e'
or
'npm run cypress:open'

If you get an error, you may need to first run the project:
'npm start'
